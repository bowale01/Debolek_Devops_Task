Step 1 :- To install minikube on x86â€“64 mac OS, run the following two commands:-

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-amd64 sudo install minikube-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

Step 2 :- Use the following command to start a cluster:-

minikube start

Step 3:- Use the following command to confirm minikube is running:

minikube status

To ensure high availability and scalability for your Nginx test site for the choosen application on our Kubernetes cluster, i need:

We already have a master node which we called "control plane" 

Worker Nodes: At least two worker nodes are recommended for fault tolerance. This setup ensures that if one worker node fails, the other node can continue serving traffic. Having more than two nodes further enhances fault tolerance and allows for better distribution of resources.
Pods: You need multiple replicas of the Nginx pod to achieve fault tolerance and scalability. By having multiple replicas spread across different nodes, your application can continue to serve traffic even if one or more pods or nodes fail. Additionally, scaling the number of replicas based on CPU load ensures that your application can handle increased traffic efficiently.


Worker Nodes: Start with at least two worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. You can scale up the number of nodes based on your application's resource requirements and expected traffic. Kubernetes provides features like automatic node scaling to help manage node resources efficiently.


minikube start --nodes 3 -p k8cluster 

check the nodes

Pod Replicas: Define a Kubernetes Deployment with multiple replicas for your Nginx application. Kubernetes will automatically distribute these replicas across the available worker nodes in the cluster. Additionally, you can configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU utilization to automatically scale the number of pod replicas up or down to meet demand.
